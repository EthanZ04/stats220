# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me: I am a 20 year old international student, I am 5 foot 11 and my birthday is on the first day of December. Some of the things I like to do include reading, watching movies, playing my guitar and working out.

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science (Bachelors)
- I am taking STATS 220 because I have prior experience in programming and a very stressful second semester (4 stage 3 Compsci papers including the capstone, sheesh) and I had a pretty nice experience in STATS 108 which made me more interested in stats.
- I am interested in learning about data analyis or data handling in general I think, cause that's what this course mainly teaches right??

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is (legit how I feels, and the discription didn't specify not to use colourful language so...)\
