# stats220

## This is my repo for STATS 220: 

### _A few facts about me_: 
1. I am a 20 year old international student.
2. I am 5 foot 11 and my birthday is on the first day of December.
3. I like reading, watching movies, playing my guitar ~~eating~~ and working out.
4. I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science (**Bachelors**)
5. My [totally not fake YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDia3e12czc).

### _STATS 220, behind the scenes_:
* I am taking STATS 220 because I have prior experience in programming and a very stressful second semester (4 stage 3 Compsci papers including the capstone, sheesh) and I had a pretty nice experience in STATS 108 which made me more interested in stats:
  * I have also took stats when I was in year 13 since I couldn't pick calculus due to my timetable clash, I guess it is my destiny lol.
* I am interested in learning about data analyis or data handling in general I think, **cause that's what this course mainly teaches right??**
